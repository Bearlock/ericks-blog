<h2 id="whoa-hey">Whoa, hey</h2>

<p>It&rsquo;s been a while right? I barely recognize you (or myself). It&rsquo;s been about four months now with nary an update or peep out of me. Not really good attendance. To be honest, I feel a bit guilty. Not too guilty mind you &ndash; just a bit. Life has been more unexpected than I expected. Things came up, things happened, balls were dropped, mistakes were made, assignments were overdue, vacations were had, companies closed, and opportunites arose.</p>

<h3 id="it-s-been-a-heck-of-a-ride">It&rsquo;s been a heck of a ride.</h3>

<p>Let&rsquo;s rewind the clock about four months. I had just gotten done writing this  <a href="/2016/02/messing-with-lakka-and-chromebox/">beauty of a post</a>. Sadly, I can&rsquo;t say that I&rsquo;ve updated or really touched the Chromebox after finally getting Lakka onto it. I don&rsquo;t want to make any excuses; all I can say is that life got busy. School was hitting pretty hard at that time and I didn&rsquo;t want to fall behind. I was (stupidly) taking another 18 credit semester. Around the middle of March, I took a week long vacation with my wife and sister for Spring Break and visited two of my very good friends in Pennsylvania. It was a wonderful vacation and a good break. Please, allow me to regale you with some vacation photos.</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR lots of vacation photos below as well as an explanation towards my bloggy absence</strong></p>

<p>Landed in Philly. Longest (perceived) flight of my life.</p>

<p><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Cdg6WzfXIAARlpl.jpg" alt="Lehigh" /></p>

<p>This is the Lehigh Valley. Its where my friends live. It is home to a sleepy college town with some great architecture. If you&rsquo;ve ever watched Madmen, Bethelehem steel is based out of this valley.</p>

<p>Speaking of which, I&rsquo;d recommend hitting up the Steel Stacks; its an old steel mill/foundry, except it has been repurposed as a sort of downtown/event hub.</p>

<p><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Cdg6xm9WoAAKQPY.jpg" alt="Elevation" /></p>

<p>This was the highest point in the valley. Turns out Pennsylvania has got nothing on Utah&rsquo;s elevation. I will concede that the Blue Ridge Mountains were pretty (and there&rsquo;s a great <a href="https://youtu.be/L5dUsZ4Djd0">Fleet Foxes</a> song by the same name).</p>

<p>My friend is working towards a PhD in physics at Lehigh University.</p>

<p><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CdhkAFpW4AEaPN1.jpg" alt="Stained Glass" /></p>

<p>Not only is it home to some beautiful and historic East Coast architecture, its got a wonderful stained glass dome in the library. To be honest, I was a little jealous that my university didn&rsquo;t have the same.</p>

<p><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Cdh1q3xW0AEBlfh.jpg" alt="Lion" /></p>

<p>This picture is a pretty good indicator of how tired I was as well as a good example as to why I&rsquo;m avoiding redeye flights in the future. I just can&rsquo;t do it. Planes are cramped and uncomfortable, I&rsquo;m a big guy, and this makes sleeping pretty impossible. In this state of mind, I didn&rsquo;t question getting cozy with Penn State&rsquo;s Nittany Lion.</p>

<p>After bumming around in my buddy&rsquo;s town for a bit (and severely taking advantage of his and his fiance&eacute;&rsquo;s hospitality) we went on a couple hour bus ride to New York City.</p>

<p><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CdmtXAsWIAAlQL3.jpg:large" alt="Spain" /></p>

<p>New York can be pretty intimidating. Its just a mass of activity, noise, smells, and movement. Its different to what I&rsquo;m used to, but it was a pretty great experience. One of the first things we did there (can&rsquo;t remember if this was before or after checking out the <a href="http://www.museumofsex.com/">Museum of Sex</a>) was eat some delightful Spanish food.</p>

<p><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CdnOsuZWoAA5orU.jpg" alt="Tall Buildings" /></p>

<p>I quickly learned that buildings in New York were just like in the movies; pretty dang tall.</p>

<p><blockquote class="twitter-video" data-lang="en"><p lang="und" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/navGb3Fw8R">pic.twitter.com/navGb3Fw8R</a></p>&mdash; Erick Diaz (@Bearlock_ed) <a href="https://twitter.com/Bearlock_ed/status/709835093985071104">March 15, 2016</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>And my hotel room had a pretty kickass view of those tall buildings.</p>

<p><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CdnzaoJXEAAAztZ.jpg" alt="Street Food" /></p>

<p>I ate street food.</p>

<p><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CdogSd9UAAAcN9J.jpg" alt="Times Square" /></p>

<p>I was overwhelmed by Times Square.</p>

<p><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CdorcxlWoAES3l7.jpg" alt="Cuban Food" /></p>

<p>I ate some amazing Cuban food and booze after watching the Book of Mormon musical.</p>

<p>I checked out the Empire State,</p>

<p><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CdpH1l9W4AQItWv.jpg" alt="Empire State Building" /></p>

<p>along with the view.</p>

<p><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CdpF8jZXEAANW0g.jpg" alt="Empire State view" /></p>

<p>I took touristy photos on the Brooklyn Bridge</p>

<img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CdriB1gUIAAHfLy.jpg" alt="Brooklyn3" /></p>

<p>I hit up shops in China Town</p>

<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>I ate some fantastic Bao</p>

<p><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Cdr8mW8WwAAGO0r.jpg" alt="Steam Buns" /></p>

<p>I found a hat store</p>

<p><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CdsfGk-UsAEzdwU.jpg" alt="Silly Hat" /></p>

<p>I was exhausted sometimes</p>

<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>After our one night stay in New York, we made our way back to Pennsylvania to spend the rest of our spring break. The city was something else; the experience isn&rsquo;t something that I&rsquo;ll be forgetting anytime soon.</p>

<p>We hit up a cool and small time Farmer&rsquo;s Market. Needless to say, I was jealous of the Allentown Farmer&rsquo;s Market (and still want something like this near where I live).</p>

<p><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Cdw2uE9WoAIwYxq.jpg" alt="Farmer's Market" /></p>

<p>Afterwards we drove into the Poconos and found a cold and windy lake.</p>

<p>I would later jump into the lake just wearing my skivvies, but that isn&rsquo;t something I&rsquo;m gonna post here :grin:</p>

<p>I visited the Philidelphia home of Edgar Allen Poe</p>

<img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Cd6tdxfW4AAfyNd.jpg" alt="Poe2" /></p>

<p>I ate at Pat&rsquo;s Steaks and had a pretty alright Philly Cheesesteak</p>

<p><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Cd7GEkJWIAABKVD.jpg" alt="Pat's" /></p>

<p>I hit up the M&uuml;tter Museum</p>

<p><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Cd7m8r2WwAAtj0s.jpg" alt="Mutter" /></p>

<p>I took more touristy photos</p>

<p>And finally finished up the trip with some Pakistani food. It was incredibly spicy, but pretty good.</p>

<p><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Cd8X_WLWoAA_QXn.jpg" alt="Pakistani food" /></p>

<p>Special thanks to my friends (you know who you are) for extending an invite to my wife, my sister, and I to come out to the East Coast and have a great and hectic time. Bucket List items were crossed off of several people&rsquo;s list because of this trip. I hope to see both of you again soon.</p>

<h2 id="post-trip">Post-trip</h2>

<p>The vacation was necessary at this point in my life. Work and school were getting pretty heavy, so getting away was a nice stress relief. The worst thing about a vacation however, is coming back to all the stress that was left behind. I didn&rsquo;t work on any schoolwork on my trip (fie and shame), and as such, I didn&rsquo;t get a respite when I came back. At this point finals were looming their ugly, sadistic head so I begin to shift into panic/survival mode. Still, I don&rsquo;t regret taking in the East Coast to its fullest; schoolwork would have hampered that experience.</p>

<p>Unfortunately,  work started giving me some hardcore weird vibes. Vibes that invoked my need to preserve myself. I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve mentioned where I work(ed). I was a Jr. Software Dev turned pseudo-Sysadmin at Template of Doom (formerly Gearshift Technologies). It was a small development and IT outfit where we did mostly client work. It was one of my first real &lsquo;grownup&rsquo; jobs and I enjoyed it; coming into work wasn&rsquo;t a hassle.</p>

<p>The weird vibes started some time before my trip to the East Coast; my spidey senses really started tingling when I came back to find my iMac, mouse, and keyboard all missing. I still had my work laptop, but preferred working on that massive iMac screen, so I started asking around about what happened. Turns out the owner had started **selling off some equipment (DANGER DANGER RUN). ** I casually (kinda) started keeping my ear to the ground for work; keeping my options open in case the something happened. And boy, am I glad I did &ndash; Because the worst happened.</p>

<h2 id="unemployment">Unemployment</h2>

<p>It was a spring Friday morning when I lost my job. The owner of the company came downstairs and informed me that the company could no longer keep its doors open. Since we were involved in a client-based business it was usually feast or famine. Well, famine happened, and the most recent dry spell with clients had been the straw that broke the camel&rsquo;s back.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m sad the company had to close the way it did. I don&rsquo;t hold any sort of ill will towards anyone that worked there; it was fun, it was a great place, and I got to be part of a great team. I learned a ton while working there (as well as learning of the fickleness of markets). And I still have a mousepad with the company&rsquo;s logo.</p>

<p>Before the hammer came down I had the pleasure of getting into preliminary talks with two tech companies (however nothing had been promised thus far). So that was a little bit of a thin pad to land on. My sudden unemployment didn&rsquo;t help my stress levels in the slightest (let alone my wife&rsquo;s). We had bills to pay and I was the primary breadwinner in the household. This was going to put a major strain on everything; school, home life, future plans.</p>

<p>I internally panicked.</p>

<h2 id="school">School</h2>

<p>18 credits didn&rsquo;t sound so daunting anymore now that I had all the time in the world to focus on school, right? At least, that&rsquo;s what I told myself. I was wrong.</p>

<p>Losing my job made school infinitely harder.</p>

<p>I couldn&rsquo;t focus. I didn&rsquo;t want to attend class. I wanted to find work or find a way to get income and staunch the sudden loss of revenue. I stressed, I ate too much, I skipped classes when I shouldn&rsquo;t have. I withdrew within myself.</p>

<p>In short, <strong>everything</strong> kinda felt like a shit show.</p>

<p>Luckily I had a wife that loved me and was willing to put up with me. I had a bit of a social net to fall back onto (<em>Thank you unemployment checks</em>), and I was able to pull myself together enough to <em>just barely</em> not fail any classes, as well as somehow get two competing job offers. Life didn&rsquo;t suck so much, but I felt more exhausted than I ever have.</p>

<h2 id="summer">Summer</h2>

<p>Things turned out okay. I embraced summer along with embracing my new place of employment. I was lucky enough to get hired as a Software Engineer at <a href="http://www.spark.net/">Spark Networks</a>. If the site&rsquo;s tagline wasn&rsquo;t enough of an indicator of what Spark does, I&rsquo;m happy to elaborate. Spark Networks is a dating site company that manages powerhouses like Christian Mingle and JDate. I&rsquo;ve been here for a few months and can say I want to be here for a while; its a great work environment and there is good work to be had. I&rsquo;ve also had to do some quick learning here to get up to speed and I&rsquo;m sure the job will continue to push me.</p>

<p>Thankfully, this fall I&rsquo;m enrolled for 9 credits at my university. Its going to be a more mellow schedule. I&rsquo;m just now starting to be okay with the idea of going back to school in the fall.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m getting my home in order. I recently nuked my room/living spaces of junk. I don&rsquo;t think my wife and I have done a deep declutter in the time that we have been married, so we had many things that we didn&rsquo;t want, need, or enjoy. I (finally) laid down some sod in my backyard. Everything is looking pretty decent!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m also just starting to get that fire back for side projects (hence the blog post). Its slow going. I think this is the first real side project-thing I have done since what happened a few months ago. Spring was hard and extinguished my fire quite a bit. But my core is stabilizing and I&rsquo;m slowly working up to being able to enjoy side projects/side learning again.</p>

<p>Things are good, and they&rsquo;re getting better.</p>

<p>Sorry about falling off the face of the Earth, sorry about the wall of text/pictures above, and thank you for reading!</p>
