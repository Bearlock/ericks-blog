          What to do One of the biggest issues I face when I get a new project-computer or toy is the dilemma of picking what to do with it. The computer itself is a blank slate; truly a paragon of hope, and possibility. It gets to the point where I get overwhelmed with all the choices I have. There are quite literally hundreds of projects that I drown in the fractals of choice.

          Free and Open Source Software Open source software is quickly becoming a necessary staple and cornerstone to software development itself and the advancement thereof. A recent(ish) study conducted by Black Duck Software (OSS logistics and legal problem solver) and North Bridge (venture capitalists that grow businesses) displayed just how important open source projects are becoming - at least in the corporate and business sphere. The aforementioned survey showed some pretty interesting results.

          Python&rsquo;s Such a Pretty Language Revisiting old Python code is always such a treat. Its easy to see what was going on and what the code is actually doing. It is so simple to trace and read, rarely do I ever ask myself &gt;What idiot wrote this?
Only to later find out through a commit or comment that I was in fact the idiot burgeoning genius that wrote it.

          Reflections on the past few weeks For the past few weeks I have been immersing myself deeply in the essential core of my 5 classes and studying diligently day and night.
Was that convincing enough? I hope so. Its what I keep telling myself that I&rsquo;m doing.
In reality I&rsquo;ve been panicking, mentally sprinting to keep up, and trying to juggle work, school, and home life (buh-bye social life and hobbies!

          And so, with barely a chance to anticipate and prepare for it, the new year is upon us. Entering a new year has always been a reflective process for me; Usually I&rsquo;m filled with equal parts determination and excitement punctuated with a hint of personal, not self-loathing, maybe self-disappointment is a better word. The new year comes and I typically find myself looking at my year in review. Like most, my subconscious takes mental inventory of all the good, bad, and strange that may have happened throughout the year.

          First posts deserve a look at my first projects, at least, that&rsquo;s the line of thinking and reasoning that has been bouncing around my head for a bit. I shall declare this my First Case Study. The first class that had me cobble together an interactive, non-console, and non-trivial project was my web programming class. The class reinforced some concepts I already &ldquo;knew&rdquo; (basic HTML and DOM manipulation) and introduced me to stuff that was kinda magical (HTTP GET and POST requests, server vs client side storage, cookies, etc).

          Hey! The name&rsquo;s Erick. This is my initial foray into using Pelican as a way to manage a &lsquo;blog&rsquo;. I&rsquo;ve always intended to start one up but never quite committed. I&rsquo;ve built my own pseudo-blog in Django, I&rsquo;ve dabbled with Ghost, and I have extensive experience using Wordpress to build sites for others; Django was great, but it was a bit heavy for what I was intending on doing. It seems like a great way to build an application (with a blog maybe tacked on).
