        <p>Hey! The name&rsquo;s Erick. This is my initial foray into using Pelican as a way to manage a &lsquo;blog&rsquo;. I&rsquo;ve always intended to start one up but never quite committed. I&rsquo;ve built my own pseudo-blog in Django, I&rsquo;ve dabbled with Ghost, and I have extensive experience using Wordpress to build sites for others; Django was great, but it was a bit heavy for what I was intending on doing. It seems like a great way to build an application (with a blog maybe tacked on). Ghost was pretty, but I really just want stupid simple, and I want to be able to deploy my content on any server (not always possible). Wordpress is fine, but like Django, it doesn&rsquo;t fit my use case. It has gone beyond a blogging platform and become something else entirely. At the end of the day, all I want to do is put my thoughts and experiences down on digital paper. Pelican seemed like a great choice because all it does is churn out static HTML pages. No databases are involved, no dynamic content, nothing to pollute the purity of my thought-forms (and not to mention less worries about security).</p>

<p>So, here we both are. You, reading my (not so) creative ramblings whilst I make rapid clacking sounds and try to make inspiration <strong><em>flow</em></strong> from my fingertips into the keyboard.</p>

<p>&hellip;</p>

<p>Its a work in progress. Maybe a little bit of my background would help?</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m Erick Diaz! I&rsquo;m a Junior at Utah Valley University. I&rsquo;m pursuing a degree in Software Engineering from the School of Technology and Computing (sounds official right?).</p>

<p>I am currently employed at <a href="http://www.templateofdoom.com">Template of Doom</a>/<a href="http://www.gearshifttech.com">Gearshift Technologies</a> and I fulfill both the roles of Developer and Systems Administrator. During my tenure here, I have been exposed to a myriad of different ideas, methodologies, and ways of doing things; it has frankly been a little overwhelming, but its also been incredibly fulfilling. I feel that I&rsquo;m challenged every day at work; sometimes I even get tossed into the deep end and outside of my comfort zone. However, I like to remind myself that because of these harrowing experiences, <strong>I&rsquo;m actually learning</strong>. In my short experience I&rsquo;ve found out first hand that knowledge really is power, and in the tech industry even more so. And it isn&rsquo;t necessarily that I want the edge to compete (to some extent I do), I want to be better than I was; I hate feeling ignorant or helpless, and I definitely take a hands-on approach to most tech tools and concepts.</p>

<p>Prior to working at Template of Doom, I worked as a Level 2 Tech Support Engineer at Bluehost. It was a good experience overall and definitely exposed me to some very important concepts (I didn&rsquo;t know what ports were!). I can&rsquo;t say that it was my favorite, but I also can&rsquo;t say that I like tech support work or work where every minute of my day is inspected and scrutinized.</p>

<p>Before <em>that</em> I worked at Lowe&rsquo;s mixing paint, before that I worked as networking technician for a local small business, and <strong>finally</strong> before all of that, my first job was being a repair technician at a vacuum and sewing machine shop. The majority of my work experience has involved problem solving to some extent. This is a pretty strong indicator to me that I&rsquo;m addicted to the immense feeling of satisfaction I get when I figure something out.</p>

<p>I work with all sorts of tools, languages, and technologies on a daily basis so I can&rsquo;t say that I am incredibly partial to one or another; I believe that there exists the right tool for the right job. At the moment I primarily work in the sphere of web development so I am most familiar with web technologies (LAMP, LEMP, &amp; MEAN stacks, JavaScript, HTML, etc) I would say I&rsquo;m more comfortable in the back end of a stack taking care of function, but I am competent at front end development and can make a useable and user friendly interface.</p>

<p>On a more personal level, I am an avid reader, an armchair philosopher, a Linux aficionado, an advocate of FOSS, a video game enthusiast, and a lover of dogs. I live in the heart of Utah and love every second I get to spend in its various peaks and deserts.</p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t really say what the content of this blog is going to be like, or how often I will have the ability to write. There will probably be musings and thoughts on various technologies, maybe a tutorial about a cool tool I found, case studies about things I have built, and maybe some content that has nothing to do with tech interspersed between all of that. I don&rsquo;t want to limit this blog too much. I can say I probably won&rsquo;t talk about religion or politics; passions run high with both of those topics and I&rsquo;d rather not spark internet fights. Those types of conversations happen best in person and with a level head.</p>

<p>I know right now I&rsquo;m really just writing to a non-existent audience, but if you have taken the time to read this and don&rsquo;t hate me, thanks!</p>
