          I don&rsquo;t usually do this Pubicly self-reflect that is.
I usually write about tech stuff and programming. It&rsquo;s what I do; it&rsquo;s easy enough to pump out, and it&rsquo;s compact and digestible on the web. It looks good on a resume and it makes me look like a pseudo-intellectual. Writing about programming doesn&rsquo;t require poetry or prose. It can be about as engaging as a math textbook. And while I&rsquo;m sure I have dear family and friends that read this, I can confidently say that they aren&rsquo;t reading anything on this site expecting to get any sort of emotional sustenance, visceral reaction, or a challenge to their beliefs.

          Frontend programming is hard Frontend programming is difficult to do rigorously. It&rsquo;s too easy to cobble together some frontend code that kinda works. Crafting a good user experience with a coherent UI is a craft and a science. And to be honest, a good UX/UI usually makes or breaks a product. The word often tossed around in regards to a good UI is &ldquo;delightful&rdquo;. A quick Google search yields the following definition for delight:

          What Does It Mean to Be a Good Engineer? This is a loaded question; it hounds me in times of self-doubt. It&rsquo;s often followed by the question, &ldquo;am I a good engineer?&rdquo;. Honestly, I already grapple with the concept and definition of the word &ldquo;good&rdquo;. To deconstruct what it could mean to be a &ldquo;good engineer&rdquo; is beyond me. I like to sit and think I&rsquo;m a good engineer, that I do good by my title and by the things I achieve.

          I Dig Node I remember when I was a fledgling programmer and Node was something I had just learned about; I remember thinking &ldquo;Server side Javascript? That sounds like the worst thing ever&rdquo;. After tinkering with it and working with it professionally for about a year, I had a change of heart. Node fulfills a specific niche on the web, and it does the job well. Critics will often point to Node&rsquo;s error handling capabilities, single-threadedness, type safety (and other JS specific issues) as deal breakers.

          Principles and Patterns (I wax lyrically a bit about software design; if you just want the code click here)
My Principles and Patterns of Software Design class (what a mouthful) was one of the most important classes I took during my time at UVU. Most of the subject matter was based off of a modified set of GoF patterns. Whether you love or hate the patterns, you have to admit that they were and continue to be an influencing force in the software development world.

          C++ is weird Some people love it and others would rather remove their fingernails with pliers than program in it. I find myself falling in both camps; sometimes at the same time. I have an inkling that my software engineering journey has a lot to do with my feelings towards it. C++ is my&hellip; educational progenitor language maybe? Essentially I was forced to use it all throughout my university experience.

Its been about nine months now. Change is constant and inevitable. In this year alone I have:
 Gotten a new and exciting job, Bought a beautiful dream home, and Began wrapping up my last year of college  Several big and life altering changes. Its sad to say, but writing here took a backseat to the other priorities in my life.

          Whoa, hey It&rsquo;s been a while right? I barely recognize you (or myself). It&rsquo;s been about four months now with nary an update or peep out of me. Not really good attendance. To be honest, I feel a bit guilty. Not too guilty mind you &ndash; just a bit. Life has been more unexpected than I expected. Things came up, things happened, balls were dropped, mistakes were made, assignments were overdue, vacations were had, companies closed, and opportunities arose.
