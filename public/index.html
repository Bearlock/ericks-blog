          C++ is weird Some people love it and others would rather remove their fingernails with pliers than program in it. I find myself falling in both camps; sometimes at the same time. I have an inkling that my software engineering journey has a lot to do with my feelings towards it. C++ is my&hellip; educational progenitor language maybe? Essentially I was forced to use it all throughout my university experience.

Hacktoberfest If you don&rsquo;t know what that is, here is a short snippet from the official Hacktoberfest website
 Hacktoberfest is a month-long celebration of open source software
 Simple enough explanation. I decided to participate for a couple of reasons:

Its been about nine months now. Change is constant and inevitable. In this year alone I have:
 Gotten a new and exciting job, Bought a beautiful dream-home, and Began wrapping up my last year of college  Several big and life-altering changes. Its sad to say, but writing here took a backseat to the other priorities in my life.

          It&rsquo;s been quite a year Turns out when school is in session, I&rsquo;m not the best at keeping this thing updated; my apologies. I feel like that&rsquo;s okay though. I may not be great at keeping on top of this, but I still have a vested interest in maintaining this blog &ndash; at least, when I have some free time (whoo winter break!). As usual, and according to the dictates of the universe, I&rsquo;m busy with school, work, side-projects, friends, video-games; the list goes on.

          Whoa, hey It&rsquo;s been a while right? I barely recognize you (or myself). It&rsquo;s been about four months now with nary an update or peep out of me. Not really good attendance. To be honest, I feel a bit guilty. Not too guilty mind you &ndash; just a bit. Life has been more unexpected than I expected. Things came up, things happened, balls were dropped, mistakes were made, assignments were overdue, vacations were had, companies closed, and opportunites arose.

          What to do One of the biggest issues I face when I get a new project-computer or toy is the dilemma of picking what to do with it. The computer itself is a blank slate; truly a paragon of hope, and possibility. It gets to the point where I get overwhelmed with all the choices I have. There are quite literally hundreds of projects that I drown in the fractals of choice.

          Free and Open Source Software Open source software is quickly becoming a necessary staple and cornerstone to software development itself and the advancement thereof. A recent(ish) study conducted by Black Duck Software (OSS logistics and legal problem solver) and North Bridge (venture capitalists that grow businesses) displayed just how important open source projects are becoming - at least in the corporate and business sphere. The aforementioned survey showed some pretty interesting results.

          Python&rsquo;s Such a Pretty Language Revisiting old Python code is always such a treat. Its easy to see what was going on and what the code is actually doing. It is so simple to trace and read, rarely do I ever ask myself &gt;What idiot wrote this?
Only to later find out through a commit or comment that I was in fact the idiot burgeoning genius that wrote it.

          Reflections on the past few weeks For the past few weeks I have been immersing myself deeply in the essential core of my 5 classes and studying diligently day and night.
Was that convincing enough? I hope so. Its what I keep telling myself that I&rsquo;m doing.
In reality I&rsquo;ve been panicking, mentally sprinting to keep up, and trying to juggle work, school, and home life (buh-bye social life and hobbies!

          And so, with barely a chance to anticipate and prepare for it, the new year is upon us. Entering a new year has always been a reflective process for me; Usually I&rsquo;m filled with equal parts determination and excitement punctuated with a hint of personal, not self-loathing, maybe self-disappointment is a better word. The new year comes and I typically find myself looking at my year in review. Like most, my subconscious takes mental inventory of all the good, bad, and strange that may have happened throughout the year.
