## Oh Hey!

I'm Erick Diaz. I'm a software engineer by trade and I like to pretend that I can write. This here is a blog that I'm bad at updating, but I drop the occasional nugget of wisdom. Mostly it's a place for me to put thoughts to digital paper, document some of my learnings, and wax lyrical into the void.

I currently work at [BambooHR][work] making the world a better place through delightful HR software. Feel free to DM me on Twitter [@Bearlock_ed][handle] if you've got any questions, comments, or concerns.

Anyway, I like lists. Here are a few of my favorite things.

## Games I'm playin':

- [Hollow Knight][game1] 
- [Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice][game2] 
- [Hades][game3] 

## Books I'm readin':

- [Four Thousand Weeks][book1]
- [Designing Data-Intensive Applications][book2]
- [Staff Engineer][book3] 

## Tools I'm jivin':

- [iTerm2][tool1]
- [Vim][tool2]
- [ChunkWM][tool3]
- [skhd][tool4]
- [Notion][tool5]
