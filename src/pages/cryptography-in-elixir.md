## The World depends on Cryptography

And I've been trying to learn it for some time now. It's always on my backlog, peeking it's head out any time I read about SSL, any time I hear about security vulnerabilities, or whenever someone is shilling the latest and greatest cryptocurrency. Just to make it clear, I understand that `cryptography != cryptocurrency`. However, much of [cryptocurrency depends on cryptography][howbitcoinworks]. When I was a teenager I read [Digital Fortress][digitalfortress], a techno-thriller by Dan Brown (surprise, surprise). Though the book was rife with inaccuracies, it sparked a fascination within me in regards to cryptography. Like most programming related things, I'm not good at crypto and I only have a surface level understanding of it. And like most things I don't understand, it seems pretty amazing and magical.

## Elixir is fun

I like toying with languages. I have a soft spot in my heart for functional programming languages, so naturally when [Elixir][elixir] came onto my radar I had to check it out.
