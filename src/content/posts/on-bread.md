**_Bread for all, and roses too_**

There is magic intrinsic to bread.

It permeates all cultures and mythos. There are ceremonies and rituals and practices revolving it; in the baking, consuming, and sharing thereof. Bread defines relationships and is foundational to power and politics. Breaking bread with someone is an act of friendship. Denying the people their bread — sneering that they eat cake — incites revolution. 

**_Give us this day our daily bread_**

It is the body of Christ and the fruit of Demeter; it is offerings to the dead to ease their passage and it is the reward of heroes, to lift and sustain them. It is the staple of the lowly and the poor; the ultimate goal of the working man and woman. Ownership and stewardship over bread is power over people. For what is a _lord_ but the _loaf ward_ — he who guards the bread.

A little flour, any kind; a little cool water; sometimes leavened with yeast, sometimes not; and if you're lucky, a little salt. Mix and pound and stretch and finally bake or fry or sear. Transform these simple ingredients and you yield the staff of life.

**_Two things only the people anxiously desire — bread and circuses_**

i've been thinking about and baking bread recently; eating it too. Today is the lunar new year which brings to mind an old apocryphal expression, credited to our Chinese friends, "_May you live in interesting times_".

And so, with the interesting times, I retreat into interesting pursuits — the thinking and baking and eating of bread.

Growing a sourdough starter has been a science. Baking a beautiful bread from it has proven to be an art; one that I'm still refining. It is a hearkening to a common human ancestry. It is a small refusal of modern consumption and participation in breadbasket capitalism. It is a way to slow down and center and reinforce my hearth 'n' home.  It is an expression of love and delight and hope for those that I feed — and I love feeding people. It is a way to build and reinforce my folks and share dumb bread pics with family and friends.

And it is a small rebellion and a form of everyday resistance. It is a reaffirmation of community and internal peace and a rejection of the fruits and words and lies of tyrants and demagogues. 

It is a reminder that this too shall pass.
